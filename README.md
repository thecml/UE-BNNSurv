# Uncertainty Estimation in Deep Bayesian Survival Models

# *UPDATE 11/16/23: pip package now available. Use "pip install bnnsurv". Tested with TensorFlow 2.13 and TensorFlow Probability 0.21. See [test file](https://github.com/thecml/UE-BNNSurv/blob/main/tests/test_bnn_surv.py) for how to use.

This repository is the official TensorFlow implementation of [Uncertainty Estimation in Deep Bayesian Survival Models](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10313466), BHI 2023.

The proposed method is implemented based on [TensorFlow Probability](https://github.com/tensorflow/probability).

In this work, we introduce the use of Bayesian inference techniques for survival analysis in neural networks that rely on the Coxâ€™s proportional hazard assumption, for which we discuss a new flexible and effective architecture. We implement three architectures: a fully-deterministic neural network that acts as a baseline, a Bayesian model using variational inference and one using Monte-Carlo Dropout.

Experiments show that the Bayesian models improve predictive performance over SOTA neural networks in a test dataset with few samples (WHAS500, 500 samples) and provide comparable performance in two larger ones (SEER and SUPPORT, 4024 and 8873 samples, respectively)
