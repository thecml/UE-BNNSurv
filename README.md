# Uncertainty Estimation in Deep Bayesian Survival Models

This repository is the official TensorFlow implementation of [Uncertainty Estimation in Deep Bayesian Survival Models](https://bhiconference.github.io/BHI2023/2023/pdfs/1570918354.pdf), BHI 2023.

The proposed method is implemented based on [TensorFlow Probability](https://github.com/tensorflow/probability).

<b>Full paper will be published on IEEE Xplore as part of BHI 2023 proceedings. ETA October 2023</b>

In this work, we introduce the use of Bayesian inference techniques for survival analysis in neural networks that rely on the Coxâ€™s proportional hazard assumption, for which we discuss a new flexible and effective architecture. We implement three architectures: a fully-deterministic neural network that acts as a baseline, a Bayesian model using variational inference and one using Monte-Carlo Dropout.

Experiments show that the Bayesian models improve predictive performance over SOTA neural networks in a test dataset with few samples (WHAS500, 500 samples) and provide comparable performance in two larger ones (SEER and SUPPORT, 4024 and 8873 samples, respectively)
