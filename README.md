# Uncertainty Estimation in Deep Bayesian Survival Models

This repository is the official TensorFlow implementation of "Uncertainty Estimation in Deep Bayesian Survival Models", BHI 2023.

The proposed method is implemented based on the TensorFlow Probability package: https://github.com/tensorflow/probability

Full paper will be available soon on IEEE Xplore.

In this work we introduce the use of Bayesian inference techniques for survival analysis in neural networks that rely on the Coxâ€™s proportional hazard assumption, for which we discuss a new flexible and effective architecture. We implement three architectures: a fully-deterministic neural network that acts as a baseline, a Bayesian model using variational inference and one using Monte-Carlo Dropout.

Experiments show that the Bayesian models improve predictive performance over SOTA neural networks in a test dataset with few samples (WHAS500, 500 samples) and provide comparable performance in two larger ones (SEER and SUPPORT, 4024 and 8873 samples, respectively)
